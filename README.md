[alt text: an image of a bathroom male/female indicator sign. The male stick figure has an image of a straight corridor filled with open doors overlaid on his body and a blue head. The female stick figure has an image of many closed doors arrayed in rows overlaid on her body and a pink head. In between them is a black line with green text: "accessibility should lead us to think not just about opening doors."]
I worked off of Eyman's ideas of opening doors and Costanza-Chock's discussion about how the tech field has catered primarily to white, able-bodied men, and just including more people in user testing isn't enough to create design justice.
